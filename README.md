Node.js & npm – Runtime and dependency management.

📂 Project Structure
Inside the src/ directory:
components/ → Reusable UI elements (each file must be placed in its own folder, e.g., Navbar/Navbar.jsx).
pages/ → Full-page views.
Other supporting files for rendering and styling.

⚠️ Important: Every component or page file must be placed in a dedicated folder matching its name. For example, Navbar.jsx must be stored in components/Navbar/. This is required because import paths in the codebase are configured to reference files from their respective folders.
